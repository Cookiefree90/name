# Contributing Resources

This folder host resources for ADK contributors, for example, testing samples etc.

# Samples

Samples folder host samples to test different features. The samples are usually minimal and simplistic to test one or a few scenarios.

**Note**: This is different from the [adk-samples repo](https://github.com/google/adk-samples) where it hosts more complex e2e samples for customers to use or modify directly.
