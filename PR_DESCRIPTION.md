# Fix Session State Persistence in Agent Development Kit

## Description
This PR addresses a critical issue in the ADK where session state isn't properly persisted between agent transitions in sequential pipelines. It introduces an `EnhancedStateDict` implementation with global cache synchronization to ensure critical state values persist even when session objects are copied or recreated.

## Motivation
Session state persistence is crucial for complex agent workflows where data needs to be shared between sequential agent stages. We encountered this issue while developing PhantomRecon, a security assessment tool using sequential agents that needed to share reconnaissance data, attack plans, and exploitation results.

Without this fix, agent developers face a range of issues:
- Session variables not accessible between agent transitions
- State loss in sequential pipelines
- Data not available to subsequent agents in workflows
- Need for complex workarounds with file storage or external caching

## Implementation Details
The implementation:
1. **Global State Cache**: Introduces a shared dictionary (`_GLOBAL_STATE_CACHE`) accessible to all sessions and agents
2. **EnhancedStateDict**: A full dictionary implementation that automatically syncs with the global cache
3. **InMemorySessionService Enhancement**: Updates to use the enhanced dictionary for all sessions
4. **LlmAgent and SequentialAgent Improvements**: Modified to actively ensure state consistency
5. **Debugging Support**: Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose issues

Key components:
- `EnhancedStateDict`: Implements the complete Python dictionary interface with global cache synchronization
- `InMemorySessionService` modifications: Ensures all sessions use the enhanced state dictionary 
- Agent class updates: Detects and upgrades regular dictionaries to enhanced state dictionaries

## Usage Example
The implementation is transparent to users - no code changes are needed in agent definitions:

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, SequentialAgent

# Define agents that modify state
class FirstAgent(LlmAgent):
    async def process(self, context):
        # Set state that persists to next agent
        context.session.state["key"] = "value"

class SecondAgent(LlmAgent):
    async def process(self, context):
        # Access state from previous agent
        value = context.session.state.get("key")  # Will work correctly now

# Sequential pipeline works with persistent state
pipeline = SequentialAgent(agents=[FirstAgent(), SecondAgent()])
```

## Testing Done
The implementation is thoroughly tested with:
- A dedicated test case (`test_in_memory_service.py`) verifying state persistence
- Integration testing with a complex sequential agent application (PhantomRecon)
- Various edge cases (empty state, large state objects, nested agent pipelines)

## Related Issue
This implementation addresses a fundamental limitation in ADK's session state management that impacts any application with complex sequential agent pipelines.
