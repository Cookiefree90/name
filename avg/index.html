            <h2>Project Overview and Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">Agent Versatility Gear (AVG)</span> project is an initiative to create a portable, modular wrapper toolkit designed to simplify the development, orchestration, and management of sophisticated multi-agent AI systems.
            </p>
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                The rapid proliferation of Agent Development Kits (ADKs) presents both opportunities and challenges. While each ADK offers unique strengths, the lack of interoperability and differing architectural patterns can lead to fragmented ecosystems, steep learning curves, and difficulties in reusing agent logic across platforms. AVG aims to address these challenges.
            </p>
            <h3>Core Goals of AVG:</h3>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Modularity:</span> Provide clearly defined, separable components for core agent functionalities such as knowledge management, pipeline orchestration, and underlying ADK agent abstraction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Portability & ADK-Agnosticism:</span> Design a core toolkit that can, in principle, interface with various ADKs. The initial focus is on Google ADK, but the architecture aims for future adaptability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Simplified Development:</span> Offer a standardized way to configure, build, and run agents, reducing boilerplate and abstracting away some of the complexities of individual ADKs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Enable Deep Expertise:</span> Facilitate the creation of agents with specialized domain knowledge and complex reasoning capabilities by providing robust mechanisms for knowledge integration (structured and unstructured data, RAG, knowledge graphs) and workflow management (e.g., decision models, multi-step pipelines).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Enhanced Orchestration:</span> Allow for more intuitive and powerful orchestration of multiple agents, enabling them to collaborate on complex tasks.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="architecture">
            <h2>AVG Toolkit Architecture (Conceptual)</h2>
            <p>
                AVG is envisioned as a layered toolkit. The core components, as detailed in the project's setup prompt (<code>avg.json</code>), are designed to be flexible and extensible.
            </p>
            <h3>Key AVG Components:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>KnowledgeConfigLoader:</strong> Responsible for loading and validating configurations for diverse knowledge sources. This includes APIs, databases, document collections for RAG, knowledge graphs, vector stores, and even decision models. It ensures that agents have a structured way to access the information they need.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ExpertisePipelineManager:</strong> Manages the definition, loading, and execution of 'expertise pipelines'. These pipelines are sequences of operations that leverage configured knowledge and specialized expert modules to fulfill complex queries or tasks (e.g., a RAG pipeline for answering questions from documents, a financial analysis pipeline).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>BaseExpertWrapper:</strong> An abstract base class that defines a standardized interface for wrapping underlying ADK agents or other expert system components. Concrete implementations of this wrapper will handle the specifics of interacting with a particular ADK agent (like Google ADK's <code>LlmAgent</code>) or a custom expert module.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These components work together: <code>KnowledgeConfigLoader</code> provides the 'what' (knowledge), <code>ExpertisePipelineManager</code> defines 'how' (workflows), and <code>BaseExpertWrapper</code> instances are the 'who' (the agents performing tasks within the pipelines).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="implementation">
            <h2>Implementation Details & Financial Expert Example</h2>
            <p>
                The initial proof-of-concept for AVG is being developed with a focus on a <span class="highlight">Financial Expert agent</span> using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). This use case is designed to showcase AVG's capabilities in a demanding domain.
            </p>
            <h3>The Financial Expert Agent aims to:</h3>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Access and process diverse financial data (e.g., SEC filings, market news, company fundamentals).</li>
                <li>Utilize Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for insights from large document sets.</li>
                <li>Potentially interact with knowledge graphs of financial entities.</li>
                <li>Employ decision models for tasks like investment suitability assessment.</li>
                <li>Generate actionable predictions, valuations, and reports.</li>
                <li>Integrate external tools for real-time data fetching (e.g., stock prices, financial news APIs via ADK Tools).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <code>avg.json</code> file contains a detailed prompt for an LLM to scaffold this entire project, including the AVG toolkit structure (in <code>adk_avg_toolkit/</code>) and the specific financial expert implementation (in <code>financial_expert_agent/</code>). This includes defining concrete expert wrappers for financial tasks, necessary ADK tools, and example configurations.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="dependencies">
            <h2>Core Dependencies</h2>
            <p>The AVG project, particularly its initial Financial Expert implementation, relies on several key technologies:</p>

                        <li>ADK <code>Runner</code> and <code>SessionService</code> for agent execution and state management.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Vertex AI:</strong> For accessing powerful Generative AI models (e.g., Gemini series) that power the ADK agents.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Standard Python Libraries:</strong>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="google-adk">
            <h2>Integration with and Advancement of Google ADK</h2>
            <p>
                AVG is not intended to replace Google ADK but rather to <span class="highlight">complement and enhance it</span> for specific development paradigms.
            </p>
            <h3>Leveraging Google ADK's Strengths:</h3>
            <p>
                AVG's initial implementation heavily relies on Google ADK's robust features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code-First Approach:</strong> Aligns with ADK's philosophy, allowing developers fine-grained control.
                <li><strong>Access to Vertex AI Models:</strong> Enables AVG-wrapped agents to use state-of-the-art Gemini models.
                <li><strong>Flexible Tooling System:</strong> AVG's expert wrappers will integrate ADK tools for diverse functionalities.
                <li><strong>Orchestration Primitives:</strong> While AVG introduces its own pipeline management, it can still leverage ADK's underlying agent orchestration capabilities (e.g., running multiple ADK agents that are themselves wrapped by AVG's <code>BaseExpertWrapper</code>).
            </ul>
            <h3>How AVG Concepts Could Advance the Ecosystem:</h3>
            <p>
                The architectural patterns being explored in AVG – such as standardized wrappers, declarative knowledge configuration, and explicit pipeline management for expertise – could offer valuable insights for the broader agent development community, including potential future enhancements or extensions to ADKs like Google's. By focusing on making complex expertise portable and configurable, AVG aims to contribute to discussions around:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Paving the way for easier integration of agents built with different underlying technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Promoting the reuse of not just tools, but also configured knowledge components and expertise workflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Higher-Level Abstractions:</strong> Providing developers with more abstract, powerful constructs for building sophisticated agents without getting lost in the low-level details of each specific ADK.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="future-state">
            <h2>Future State of AVG</h2>
            <p>The long-term vision for Agent Versatility Gear extends beyond the initial Google ADK implementation.</p>
