# Purpose: Generate the Python code for financial_expert_agent/expert_wrappers.py. This file should contain concrete subclasses of BaseExpertWrapper (from adk_avg_toolkit.base_expert_wrapper) for financial tasks. Examples:
# 1. CompanyDataRetriever(BaseExpertWrapper): Wraps an ADK LlmAgent configured to fetch company data using tools (e.g., from SEC API, configured knowledge sources). Its process method would take a company identifier and return structured data.
# 2. MarketNewsAnalyzer(BaseExpertWrapper): Wraps an ADK LlmAgent that performs sentiment analysis or summarization on news articles (retrieved via a RAG pipeline).
# 3. ReportGenerator(BaseExpertWrapper): Wraps an ADK LlmAgent that takes structured data and analysis results to generate a formatted report.
# Ensure each class implements _initialize_adk_agent to set up its specific LlmAgent (model, instructions, tools) and process to handle its task. Based on avg.json content_prompt for financial_expert_wrappers_py.
