# Purpose: Generate the Python code for financial_expert_main_agent.py. This file should define the primary Financial Expert agent class (e.g., FinancialAdvisorMasterAgent). This agent will be responsible for understanding user queries related to finance, breaking them down, and delegating tasks to various specialized expert wrappers via the ExpertisePipelineManager. It should be designed to be runnable by Google ADK (e.g., inherit from an ADK agent class or be structured to be called by an ADK Runner). Outline its main interaction loop or request handling method. It should instantiate KnowledgeConfigLoader (pointing to financial_knowledge_config.yaml) and ExpertisePipelineManager. Define how it translates user requests into pipeline executions (e.g., 'get company overview for X', 'analyze market sentiment for Y', 'generate investment suitability report for profile Z'). Based on avg.json content_prompt for financial_expert_main_agent_py.
