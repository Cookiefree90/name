# Purpose: Generate the Python code for financial_expert_agent/tools.py. This file should define custom Google ADK tools. Examples:
# 1. financial_web_search_tool: A tool using GoogleSearchTool or a direct web request library, configured to prioritize financial news sites.
# 2. sec_edgar_api_tool: A tool to interact with the SEC EDGAR API (using details from KnowledgeConfigLoader). It should have methods for specific queries (e.g., get_latest_filing_for_cik).
# 3. stock_price_api_tool: A tool to fetch current or historical stock prices from a financial API.
# Each tool should be a function or class compatible with Google ADK's tool definition requirements (e.g., a function that returns a dict with 'status' and 'report'/'error_message'). Based on avg.json content_prompt for financial_expert_tools_py.

# Placeholder for actual Python code
