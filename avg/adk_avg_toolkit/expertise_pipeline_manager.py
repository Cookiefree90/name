# Purpose: Generate the Python code for expertise_pipeline_manager.py. This file should define the ExpertisePipelineManager class. It should be initializable with pipeline configurations, a knowledge loader instance, and an expert wrapper factory. Key methods include execute_pipeline(pipeline_name, query, **kwargs) and internal methods to handle pipeline execution, possibly differentiating between explicitly defined handlers and generic step-based execution. The generic execution should be able to process a list of steps, instantiate expert wrappers using the factory, and pass data between steps, including a shared context. Include the example if __name__ == '__main__': block with dummy components to test various pipeline execution scenarios (RAG, KG query, multi-step generic), as previously outlined.

# Placeholder for actual Python code
