# Purpose: Generate the Python code for knowledge_config_loader.py as discussed. It should include the KnowledgeConfigLoader class with methods to load from YAML/JSON, validate (with extensible validation for sections like 'knowledge_sources', 'ingestion_pipelines', 'knowledge_graphs', 'vector_stores', 'decision_models'), and provide getter methods for these top-level configuration sections. Include the example if __name__ == '__main__': block that loads a dummy YAML config for testing, similar to what we discussed. Ensure it handles potential file errors gracefully.

# Placeholder for actual Python code
