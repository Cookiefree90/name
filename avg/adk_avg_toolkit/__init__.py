# Purpose: Create a Python __init__.py file for the 'adk_avg_toolkit' package. It should include a brief module-level docstring explaining that this package contains the core components of the Agent Versatility Gear (AVG) toolkit. For now, it can be simple, but consider future imports of main classes like KnowledgeConfigLoader, ExpertisePipelineManager, and BaseExpertWrapper from their respective modules.

# Placeholder for actual Python code
pass
