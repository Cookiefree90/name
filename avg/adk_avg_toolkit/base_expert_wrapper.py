# Purpose: Generate the Python code for base_expert_wrapper.py. This should define the BaseExpertWrapper Abstract Base Class (ABC). It needs an __init__ method that accepts avg_expert_config and an optional adk_agent_instance. It must define abstract methods _initialize_adk_agent(self, **kwargs) and process(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs) -> Any. Also include get_capabilities() and get_underlying_agent() methods. Include the example concrete implementation ADKLlmExpert within this file (or clearly state it should be a separate file if that's better for the LLM to generate later), making sure its _initialize_adk_agent and process methods are implemented with placeholders for actual ADK LlmAgent and Runner interactions, as discussed. The if __name__ == '__main__': block should test instantiating and using ADKLlmExpert.

# Placeholder for actual Python code
